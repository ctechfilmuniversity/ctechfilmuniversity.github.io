## Abstract
Cinesphere captures and reflects the atmosphere of digital movies by measuring and reinterpreting their audiovisual features.

## Project description
The idea for this project stems from my bachelor thesis about digital methods for movie analysis. Asking myself how I could make use of movie data in a creative way I created Cinesphere as my orientation project at the beginning of my master studies. Using TouchDesigner and Ableton Live Cinesphere visualizes and sonifies multiple features like color, motion, editing and sound spectrum of any input movie in real time. 

## Implementation
