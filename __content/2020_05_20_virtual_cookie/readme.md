## Abstract
My mother and my grandmother express their love by feeding us. They love us very much, so they expect us to eat a lot. 
I created an edible virtual cookie to express my love without making other people fat. 

## Project description
Just click to eat my cookie.

## Implementation
I did this project in the P5 editor, for the Creative Coding 1 - Christmas card exercise.
