## Abstract

This is a project that I have developed for the Lecture "Theoretical Backgrounds in Audio & Graphics" with an asiatic theme.


## Project description

Winds of Kyoto started as a tribute to a missed trip to Japan because of the corona outbreak. The first component of the project is a procedural instrumental composition built from typical japanese instrument samples that was arrange in a storytelling format, narrating a conflict between the piece keeping monks and a demonic ritual. The second component was a procedural graphic that reacts to the music. The graphic reminds of an origami and uses a shader to symbolize a soul that it contains. I then realized that the visualization was well suited for an EDM track and combined the song "Pegboard Nerds - Hero (feat. Elizaveta) (Infected Mushroom Remix)" with my own musical composition.

### Disclaimer to the video

I do not own the original rights to the song. It is part of the experience and I edited it slightly. Please threat with care!

## Implementation

The audio composition was realized with Sonic Pi. And the graphical visualization was done with p5js.

## Lessons learned

* I learned to work creatively with samples
* I learned to program a compositional structure 
* I learned to create an additive synthesizer programmatically
* I learned to procedurally generate a 3D Mesh in Processing/p5
* I learned to implement shaders in the context of p5js
