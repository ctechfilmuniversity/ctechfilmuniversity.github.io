## Abstract
I focused on the lecture 01_intro/Houdini. During the project development process, I dealt with the topics of **modeling** and **rigging** in Houdini to create a basic digital asset. Modeling and rigging is the base for animation (which I did not whithin the scope of the final PGS project submission.)


## Project description
The project result could build a base for animators to animate a scene with the modeled object. To deliver the animation department a polished result the used subnetwork includes a parameter list with the controls that are allowed to use. All others are locked. 

Please find the parameter list like this:

## Implementation
To model the sheep I drew small sketches, followed by mostly try and error modeling in Houdini. To rig the model I mainly used the [SideFX human rigging series](https://www.sidefx.com/learn/collections/rigging-series/) and updated it later based on some parts of the [SideFX cat rigging series](https://www.sidefx.com/tutorials/author/Bj%C3%B8rn%20Blaabjerg%20S%C3%B8rensen/).

## Lessons learned
Rigging takes some time.
